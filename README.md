# webProject
Simple Web Project

The project was built using the following tools.

Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers.
Version: Neon Release (4.6.0)
Build id: 20160613-1800

jdk.8.0_102
JSF 2.2 (Mojarra 2.2.0)
javax.json-1.0.jar
apache-tomcat-9.0.0.M9-windows-x64

The webproject was based on the use of JSF, Java Server Faces and the upload of a file using JSON.

Test:
JSONReadFromFileTest.java

I have include the complete eclipse project and a war file.

SimpleWebProject.zip
SimpleWebProject.war

You can either deploy the war file in a webserver or import the project into Eclipse and run it on a deployed webserver like Apache-Tomcat.

I did not use the GOV.UK frontend design.
